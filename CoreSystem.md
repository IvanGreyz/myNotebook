## 🚏Overall 
In this topic, we will disscuss about the system core of **Arm Cortex**. In addition, I will use **STM HAL library** to initialize these modules by hand and applicate them.

**P/S: This topic is created base on almost STM references and CubeIDE**

## 🗒️Table of Contents
In this section, I will list all the features that I concern on CubeIDE.

Here're them:

I. **DMA (Direct Manager Access)**

II. **GPIO (General Purpose In-Out)**

III. **IWDG (Independent Watchdog)**

IV. **NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)**

V. **RCC (Reset & Clock Controller)**

VI. **SYS (SysTick timer)**

VII. **WWDG (Window Watchdog)**
